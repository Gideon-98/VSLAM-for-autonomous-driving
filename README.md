# VSLAM-for-autonomous-driving
The projectâ€™s goal is to develop a SLAM system which can successfully reconstruct trajectory on the KITTI visual odometry data set. A solution may be inspired and also based on published entries to the KITTI odometry benchmark. The report needs to very clearly indicate which parts are own innovations.
