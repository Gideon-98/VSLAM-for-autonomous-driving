## Bundle Adjustment Solution explanation
# read_bal_data
The `read_bal_data()` function takes a file path as input and returns several arrays containing initial estimates of camera and point parameters for a 3D reconstruction problem.

Here is a breakdown of the function:

1.  The function opens the file specified by the `path` parameter using the `bz2.open()` function. The `rt` mode is used to open the file as text and decompress it on the fly if necessary (the file is assumed to be compressed with bz2 compression).
2.  The first line of the file is read and parsed as integers. It contains the number of cameras, points, and observations in the data set.
3.  Three empty NumPy arrays are created to hold the camera indices, point indices, and measured 2D coordinates for each observation.
4.  A loop is used to read each line of the file containing an observation. The camera index, point index, and 2D coordinates are parsed from the line and stored in the corresponding arrays.
5.  Another loop is used to read the camera parameters from the file. There are nine parameters for each camera: three for rotation (in the form of a rotation vector), three for translation, and three for intrinsic camera parameters (focal length and two distortion parameters).
6.  Yet another loop is used to read the point coordinates from the file. There are three coordinates (x, y, z) for each point in the world frame.
7.  The function returns the camera parameters, point coordinates, camera indices, point indices, and measured 2D coordinates as NumPy arrays.

Note that there is an inconsistency in the function parameter and its usage in the function. The parameter is named `path`, but in the function body, it is referred to as `file_name`. This should be corrected by changing the function signature to use `file_name` instead of `path`.

# reindex
The `reindex` function takes a 1D array `idxs` as input and returns a new array that has the same values as `idxs`, but with the values reindex-ed to be consecutive integers starting from 0 (ordered array).

1. The function first finds the unique values in `idxs` and sorts them in ascending order using `np.sort()`. 
2. It then creates a dictionary `key_dict` that maps each unique value in `keys` to its corresponding index in the sorted `keys` array (i.e., a consecutive integer starting from 0). This is done using a dictionary comprehension that iterates over `keys` and the corresponding index values returned by `range(keys.shape[0])`. 
3. Finally, the function uses a list comprehension to map each value in `idxs` to its corresponding index in the sorted `keys` array using `key_dict`, and returns the resulting list. This effectively reindexes the values in `idxs` to be consecutive integers starting from 0, with the order of the values preserved.

# shrink_problem
This function takes as input initial estimates of camera parameters, point coordinates, and observations, and returns a shrunk version of the problem with a specified number of points. Specifically, it reduces the number of observations to n, keeps only the cameras and points involved in those observations, and reindexes the remaining observations and points.

Here is a breakdown of the function:

-   `n`: the desired number of points in the shrunk problem.
-   `cam_params`: an array of shape `(n_cameras, 9)` containing initial estimates of camera parameters. The first 3 components in each row form a rotation vector, the next 3 components form a translation vector, and the final 3 components are the focal distance and two distortion parameters.
-   `Qs`: an array of shape `(n_points, 3)` containing initial estimates of point coordinates in the world frame.
-   `cam_idxs`: an array of shape `(n_observations,)` containing indices of cameras involved in each observation.
-   `Q_idxs`: an array of shape `(n_observations,)` containing indices of points involved in each observation.
-   `qs`: an array of shape `(n_observations, 2)` containing measured 2-D coordinates of points projected on images in each observation.

The function returns:

-   `cam_params`: an array of shape `(n_cameras, 9)` containing initial estimates of camera parameters for the reduced problem.
-   `Qs`: an array of shape `(n_points, 3)` containing initial estimates of point coordinates for the reduced problem.
-   `cam_idxs`: an array of shape `(n,)` containing indices of cameras involved in each observation for the reduced problem.
-   `Q_idxs`: an array of shape `(n,)` containing indices of points involved in each observation for the reduced problem.
-   `qs`: an array of shape `(n, 2)` containing measured 2-D coordinates of points projected on images in each observation for the reduced problem.

The `cam_idxs`, `Q_idxs`, and `qs` arrays are updated to contain only the indices relevant to the reduced problem, and the `cam_idxs` and `Q_idxs` arrays are reindexed so that they start from 0 and increase sequentially. The `cam_params` and `Qs` arrays are updated to include only the cameras and points involved in the reduced problem. The function assumes that `n` is less than or equal to the number of observations in the original problem.

# rotate
This code rotates a set of 3D points by given rotation vectors using Rodrigues' rotation formula. The function takes two input arguments:

-   `Qs`: a numpy array of shape `(n_points, 3)` representing the 3D points to be rotated.
-   `rot_vecs`: a numpy array of shape `(n_points, 3)` representing the rotation vectors for each 3D point.

The function first calculates the norm of each rotation vector using `np.linalg.norm` and stores it in `theta`. It then normalizes the rotation vectors by dividing them by `theta`, and replaces any NaN values with 0 using `np.nan_to_num`.

The function then computes the dot product between each 3D point and its corresponding normalized rotation vector, and stores the result in `dot`. It also calculates the cosine and sine of `theta` using `np.cos` and `np.sin`, respectively.

Finally, the function returns the rotated 3D points using Rodrigues' rotation formula. Specifically, it computes the rotated points by adding three terms:

1.  `cos_theta * Qs`: a term that scales the original points by the cosine of `theta`.
2.  `sin_theta * np.cross(v, Qs)`: a term that represents the cross product of the normalized rotation vectors and the original points, scaled by the sine of `theta`.
3.  `dot * (1 - cos_theta) * v`: a term that scales the normalized rotation vectors by `(1 - cos_theta)` and then scales them again by `dot`, which represents the dot product between the original points and the normalized rotation vectors.

The resulting numpy array `Qs_rot` has the same shape as the input `Qs` and contains the rotated 3D points.

# project
The `project` function takes in 3D points and initial camera parameters and projects the points onto 2D images. Here's how it works:

1.  The 3D points are first rotated using the camera rotation vectors `cam_params[:, :3]`. This is done using the `rotate` function which implements the Rodrigues' rotation formula.
2.  The rotated points are then translated by the camera translation vectors `cam_params[:, 3:6]`.
3.  The points are then un-homogenized by dividing the first two coordinates by the third coordinate.
4.  Lens distortion is then applied to the un-homogenized points using the camera's focal length `f` and distortion parameters `k1` and `k2`.
5.  The final projected 2D points are returned.

Note that the `rotate` function is used to implement the Rodrigues' rotation formula, which rotates a vector `v` by an angle `theta` around an axis `k` given by a rotation vector `r`. The rotation vector `r` is a compact representation of the axis and angle of rotation, and is related to `k` and `theta` as follows:

`r = theta * k / ||k||` 

The `rotate` function takes in an array of rotation vectors `rot_vecs` and applies the rotation to an array of vectors `Qs`.

# objective
The `objective` function takes the optimization parameters, indices of cameras and 3D points, and image points as input, and returns the residuals between the observations and the reprojected points.

The function first extracts the camera parameters and 3D points from the input parameters. The camera parameters are then reshaped into a `(n_cams, 9)` array, and the 3D points are reshaped into a `(n_Qs, 3)` array.

Next, the `project` function is called to project the 3D points onto the image planes, using the camera parameters and 3D point indices specified by `cam_idxs` and `Q_idxs`. The resulting projected points are stored in `qs_proj`.

Finally, the residuals are calculated by taking the difference between the observations (`qs`) and the reprojected points (`qs_proj`), and the resulting array is flattened using `ravel()` to produce a 1D array. This 1D array is returned as the output of the `objective` function.

# BA without sparsity
The `bundle_adjustment` function stacks the input camera parameters and 3D points to create a one-dimensional array of parameters and uses `least_squares` from `scipy.optimize` to minimize the objective function. It returns the initial residuals, the residuals at the solution, and the solution.
The implementation uses the `'trf'` method for `least_squares`, which is the Trust Region Reflective algorithm that can handle both bounds and equality constraints. It also specifies the `ftol` parameter, which is the relative error desired in the sum of squares, and the `x_scale` parameter, which scales the variables during the optimization. The `verbose` parameter is set to 2 to print information at each iteration of the algorithm.

# sparsity_matrix
The `sparsity_matrix` function creates a sparse matrix that represents the sparsity pattern of the Jacobian matrix for the bundle adjustment problem. The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of first-order partial derivatives of the residuals with respect to the parameters.

The `sparsity_matrix` function takes as input the number of cameras, the number of 3D points, and the indices of the cameras and 3D points used in the image observations. It returns a sparse matrix with a shape of `(2 * num_observations, num_parameters)`, where `num_observations` is the total number of image observations and `num_parameters` is the total number of parameters in the bundle adjustment problem. The sparse matrix is stored in the Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) format, which is a common format for sparse matrices used in numerical computations.

The sparsity matrix is filled with ones at the locations where the parameters affect the residuals.
Specifically, for each camera, there are 9 camera parameters (3 for rotation, 3 for translation, and 3 for intrinsic calibration), and for each 3D point, there are 3 coordinates (x, y, z).
The sparsity matrix has a block structure, where each block corresponds to an observation (i.e., an image point) and has a size of 2 x num_parameters.
The first row of the block represents the partial derivatives of the residual with respect to each parameter for the x-coordinate of the image point, and the second row represents the partial derivatives of the residual with respect to each parameter for the y-coordinate of the image point.
The sparsity pattern of the Jacobian matrix is obtained by converting the sparse matrix to a dense matrix and then computing the transpose of the product of the sparse matrix and its transpose.

# BA with sparsity
The function `bundle_adjustment_with_sparsity` performs bundle adjustment with sparsity. It takes in the initial parameters for the cameras (`cam_params`), the 3D points (`Qs`), the indices of cameras for image points (`cam_idxs`), the indices of 3D points for image points (`Q_idxs`), the image points (`qs`), and the sparsity matrix (`sparse_mat`).

1.  the camera parameters and the 3D points are stacked together into a single parameter vector. The initial residuals are then calculated by calling the `objective` function.
2.  The `least_squares` optimization is then performed using the `objective` function, the parameter vector, and the sparsity matrix. The `jac_sparsity` argument specifies the sparsity structure of the Jacobian matrix, which is the matrix of partial derivatives of the objective function with respect to the parameters. 
3. This allows the optimization algorithm to take advantage of the sparsity of the problem and speed up the computation.

The function returns the initial residuals, the residuals at the solution, and the solution.

# BA with or without sparsity
Bundle adjustment with sparsity and without sparsity differ in the way they solve the optimization problem.
In bundle adjustment without sparsity, all the camera parameters and 3D points are considered to be independent and are optimized together to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted image points and the observed image points.
However, bundle adjustment with sparsity considers the dependencies between the camera parameters and 3D points. The sparsity matrix is used to specify which parameters affect which residuals. By using this sparsity information, the optimizer can solve the problem more efficiently by only considering the relevant parameters in each step of the optimization. This reduces the number of calculations needed and can lead to a faster and more stable convergence.
In summary, bundle adjustment with sparsity is more efficient than bundle adjustment without sparsity, especially for large-scale problems, since it takes into account the dependencies between the camera parameters and 3D points, leading to faster and more stable convergence.

# main

The `main()` function is the entry point of the program.
1. Reads in the data from a file using the `read_bal_data()` function. 
2. Shrinks the problem size by selecting a random subset of the data using the `shrink_problem()` function. 
3. Prints out the number of cameras, points, parameters and residuals in the smaller problem. 
4. Performs bundle adjustment without sparsity on the smaller problem using the `bundle_adjustment()` function and prints out the initial and minimized residuals. 
5. Performs bundle adjustment with sparsity on the original problem by first computing the sparsity matrix using the `sparsity_matrix()` function and then passing it along with the data to the `bundle_adjustment_with_sparsity()` function. 
6. Plots the sparsity pattern and the residual results of both the smaller and original problem using the `plot_sparsity()` and `plot_residual_results()` functions, respectively.

Overall, this function provides an example of how to use the functions in this module to perform bundle adjustment with and without sparsity on a set of camera and point data.
