## Bundle Block Adjustement

Bundle block adjustment (BBA) is a method used in photogrammetry to refine the position and orientation of multiple images of a scene or object, in order to create an accurate 3D model.

When multiple images are captured from different viewpoints, they will typically have slight differences in their position, orientation, and lens distortion. BBA is used to correct these differences and create a consistent 3D model by finding the optimal adjustment of the images to minimize the differences between them.

The process of BBA involves identifying common points or features in each image, and then using these points to determine the position and orientation of each image relative to the others. The positions and orientations of the cameras are then refined iteratively until a best-fit solution is found that minimizes the differences between the projected positions of the points in each image and their actual positions in 3D space.

BBA is typically performed using specialized software, which can handle large numbers of images and points, and perform the iterative adjustments efficiently. The resulting 3D model can be used for a variety of applications, such as mapping, surveying, or creating visualizations.

Overall, bundle block adjustment is an essential step in photogrammetry to ensure accurate 3D reconstruction from multiple images.
