# VSLAM-for-autonomous-driving
The project’s goal is to develop a SLAM system which can successfully reconstruct trajectory on the KITTI visual odometry data set. A solution may be inspired and also based on published entries to the KITTI odometry benchmark. The report needs to very clearly indicate which parts are own innovations.

Outcomes:

▶ Development of a comprehensive SLAM method

▶ Use of grayscale or color image information

▶ Evaluation of algorithm performance using KITTI GT

▶ Optional: use of LIDAR and/or stereo information


Current Steps :

▶ Implement KITTI into exercise 4

▶ Incorporate exercise 2's solution into exercise 4

    ▶ Report can be written at this point (BARE MINIMUM)

▶ Make exercise 4 generic for N cameras

▶ Implement Real-time visualization of mapping
